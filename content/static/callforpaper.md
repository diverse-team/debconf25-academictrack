# Call for papers
## Topics of Interest

We seek proposals aligned with Debian’s impact on science, including:
- **Scientific Software & Packaging**: Maintaining/using tools like GNU Octave, Python/R libraries, or domain-specific packages (e.g., BioDebian, NeuroDebian).
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Debian in clusters, cloud environments, HPC, or GPU-accelerated workflows. Packaging challenges for scientific software (e.g., CUDA, JAX).
- **Reproducibility & Open Science**: Debian’s role in FAIR data (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), containerization (e.g., Singularity/Podman), or reproducible environments.
- **AI/ML & Data Science**: Ethical AI frameworks, Debian-packaged libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), or open datasets. Next challenges. 
- **Cross-Disciplinary Applications**: Case studies in astronomy, genomics, climate science, or education.
- **Infrastructure & DevOps: Scientific CI/CD pipelines**, Debian in research labs, or collaborative platforms.
- **Policy & Ethics**: Licensing, open-access advocacy, or privacy in scientific workflows.
- **Privacy laws** (e.g., GDPR, CPA), AI regulation, or patent risks in FLOSS.
- **Ethical frameworks for Debian in sensitive domains** (healthcare, defense).
- **Security**: Security hardening, SBOMs, or DevOps for research infrastructure. The next challenges for reproducible builds.
- **Community & Contribution Dynamics**: Studies of FLOSS community structures, contribution practices, and sustainability in open source communities.

## Submission Formats

As the aim is to make this workshop a meeting place with the Debian community, we suggest keeping papers fairly short (up to 4 pages) with the aim of presenting the scientific work carried out and the existing or future links with the community. 

As a result, the review process will be original, with an initial acceptance pass on the abstract evaluated by the Debian community and a second pass by a scientific committee. The proceedings will be published to obtain an ISBN and a DOI associated with these papers. 

### Formatting Requirements:
Submissions must follow the [IEEETran LaTeX template](https://ctan.org/pkg/ieeetran).

Papers should clearly articulate scientific contributions and Debian community relevance (see Review Criteria below).


## Timeline

- Final abstract submission deadline on debconf25.debconf.org: **May 19, 2025**
- Abstract acceptance notifications: **May 26, 2025**
- Final full paper submission deadline: **June 19, 2025**
- Full paper acceptance notifications: **June 26, 2025**

## Targeted Audience

We welcome submissions from:
- **Computer Scientists** working on AI/ML, HPC, cybersecurity, reproducibility, or infrastructure.
- **Legal Scholars** specializing in intellectual property, open-source licensing, privacy regulations, or ethics in technology.
- **Interdisciplinary Teams** exploring topics like AI governance, compliance automation, or policy-driven software design.
- **Social Scientists** studying open source communities.


## Inclusivity & Outreach

We strongly encourage submissions from individuals and communities underrepresented in science and open-source, including:
Early-career scientists, students, and educators.
- Women, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups.
- Help us amplify diverse voices! Share this CFP with colleagues and networks beyond traditional tech circles.


## Review Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated on:
- Scientific/Technical Contribution: Novelty, rigor, and relevance to computer science or legal research.
- Debian Community Engagement: Potential to spark actionable dialogue, collaboration, or technical improvements within Debian.
- Clearly address both criteria in your proposal.

## Review will done in two steps:

- a first review by community using debconf classical submission process
- After acceptance by Debian community, submission will be evaluated according to scientific review criteria. 



## Tips for Strong Proposals

- **Debian Relevance**: Explain how your work benefits/engages the Debian community.
- **Clarity > Jargon**: Make complex topics accessible to a broad audience of developers and scientists.
- **Collaboration Hooks**: Highlight opportunities for Debian contributors to engage (e.g., packaging needs, testing).
